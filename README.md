Trainable Robotic Arm Created by Robert Svec November 2013

This Arduino based project uses a robotic arm and gripper with the Adafruit analog feedback servos to provide
a robotic arm easy training with a button press and moving the arm with your hands from position to position.

This repo contains the Arduino sketch.  I will try my best to keep this updated.
